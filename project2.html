                <h3>[Challenge] <h3></h3>
                    <p> I had to  create a compelling 30-second sonic warning, using only sound to convey a narrative and make an argument. This sound must communicate a warning to a specific audience, highlighting the consequences of ignoring it through a sequence of events. </p>

                <h3>[Reflection] </h3>
                <p> This was one of my favorite assignments because it required a lot of creative thinking. I decided to create a sound to convey the urgency of a house fire in the kitchen caused by overheating. To communicate this, I used the sound of a fire alarm and combined it with other kitchen noises, like a stove turning on and off, using CapCut to edit and layer the audio. Alongside the sound, I wrote an analysis explaining the tools I used and how rhetorical devices like urgency and alarm were employed to effectively communicate the warning. It was a rewarding project!
