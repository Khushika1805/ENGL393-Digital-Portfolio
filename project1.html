            <h1> Billboard Rhetorical Analysis</h1>
                <h3><p>[Challenge]</p></h3>
                <p>I had to conduct a detailed rhetorical analysis of a local billboard, examining its visual design, messaging, and audience targeting to evaluate its effectiveness.

                <h3>[Reflection]</h3>
                <p>This assignment gave me the chance to apply what I’ve learned about rhetorical analysis to a real-world example. I chose the Elkridge Animal Hospital billboard and analyzed its design and message to understand how it appeals to pet owners. Breaking down the visuals and text helped me see how they work together to persuade the audience. It also made me think about how the billboard could be improved to be more effective. Overall, this project helped me better understand how visual rhetoric is used in everyday life to communicate messages and influence people’s decisions.
