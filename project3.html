            <h1> Instructions Assignment</h1>
                <h3><p>[Challenge] </p></h3>
                <p> I had to create a detailed set of instructions and I decided to do it for setting up a virtual machine (VM) on a personal computer. The instructions needed to be clear, concise, and easy to follow, providing step-by-step guidance for installing the necessary software, configuring the VM settings, and launching the virtual environment. </p>

                <h3>[Analysis]</h3>

                <h3>[Reflection]</h3>
                <p> This assignment was a great opportunity to practice my technical writing skills and develop a clear, effective set of instructions. I enjoyed breaking down the process of setting up a virtual machine into simple, easy-to-follow steps and considering how to best communicate each step to a user who did not know about virtual machine and how to set it up. I also appreciated the chance to reflect on the importance of clear communication in technical writing and how it can help users successfully complete complex tasks. Overall, this assignment helped me develop a deeper understanding of the technical writing process and how to create user-friendly documentation.</p>
