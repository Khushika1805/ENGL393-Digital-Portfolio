            <h1> Digital Portfolio</h1>
                <h3>[Challenge]</h3>
                <p>In this project, I had to create a personal protfolio in the format of a website to showcase all my projects and some writing assignments completed in ENGL 393. </p>
                <h3>[Website]</h3>
                <a id="RA" href="./index.html" target="_blank">View Digital Portfolio</a>
                <h3>[Reflection]</h3>
                <p>This project was a valuable learning experience as it allowed me to apply my web development skills in a practical context. To deepen my learning for digital creation I decided to write the code to make my personal webite and make it on my own. I learned how to structure a website effectively, use CSS for styling, and ensure the site is responsive across different devices. Additionally, it was an opportunity to reflect on my academic journey and present my work in a professional manner. Overall, this project has enhanced my understanding of web development and improved my ability to create user-friendly websites. It has also given me more experience into the langauges used for this website which are Javascript, HTML, and CSS.</p>
