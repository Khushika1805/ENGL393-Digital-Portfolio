                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Hi, I‚Äôm Khushika Shah, a Computer Science and Financial Economics double major at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC). My academic interests lie at the intersection of technology and finance, where I aim to develop innovative solutions in areas like fintech and decentralized applications. I have always been passionate about problem-solving and understanding the world through the lens of data and systems, which drives my curiosity and ambition in both fields.</p>
                <p> This semester, I am taking ENGL 393, a course that focuses on the principles of technical communication. Through this class, I‚Äôve gained valuable insights into crafting clear, audience-centered messages that are crucial for success in any professional field. The projects I‚Äôve worked on include a rhetorical analysis of a local billboard, creating detailed instructions on setting up a virtual machine, and designing a Sonic Warning soundscape. These assignments have shown me how language, sound, and design can be used to convey compelling arguments and solve practical problems. This course has not only enhanced my writing and design skills but also helped me understand how to communicate complex technical ideas in accessible and impactful ways.</p>
                <p>Outside of the classroom, I‚Äôm actively involved in the UMBC community. As a member of the Center for Women in Technology (CWIT), I‚Äôve grown more confident in my abilities within STEM and found an encouraging support system. I‚Äôm also part of cultural organizations like the South Asian Student Association, where I‚Äôve formed connections with others who share similar experiences and cultural backgrounds.
                </p>
                <p>This digital portfolio is a collection of my work in ENGL 393, showcasing the skills I‚Äôve developed throughout the semester. It includes detailed projects, class reflections, and notes on topics such as modality, sentence types, and technical writing. I hope it provides a glimpse into my academic journey and personal growth this semester.
